# Cancer progonosis prediction with Artificial Intelligence and sequence-based Protein-Protein Interaction (seqPPI) 
Based on the results of our previous random motif analysis, 
we have applied random motifs to predict cancer progonosis using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and clinical reports obtained from NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC, https://gdc.cancer.gov). 
We are currently working on paper publication. 
Meanwhile, user's can freely download pilot source codes used in our previous research.

## New RMF Method for analysis human proteins and disease prognosis.

Due to the technical difficulties and high cost for obtaining 3-dimensional structure data, sequence-based approaches in proteins have not been widely acknowledged. 
A motif can be defined as any segments in protein or gene sequences. 
With this simplicity, motifs have been actively and widely used in various areas. 
However, the motif itself has not been comprehensively studied yet. 
The value of this study can be categorized in three fields in order to analyzing th human proteins using artificial intelligence method: 
(1) Based on our best knowledge, this research is the first comprehensive motif analysis by analyzing motifs with all human proteins in Protein Data Bank (PDB) associated with the database of Enzyme Commission (EC) number and Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP).
